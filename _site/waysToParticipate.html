        <p>This page is under construction. It contains a list of possible ways to participate in the project, but the list is currently incomplete. Even when it is complete, it will continually be updated as the status of our short-term goals changes.</p>

<p>For this project there will be a team of people based in Cambridge, some funded by the project and working on it full time, and others funded in different ways and devoting a proportion of their time to it. See our <a href="/human_oriented_atp/team.html">participants page</a> for more details.</p>

<p>However, we also hope very much that there will be remote participation. These pages are intended to facilitate that by setting out as clearly as possible what our short and medium term goals are, and suggesting what people can do to help us get closer to attaining them. Here we shall simply list the goals. For more details about how to help with a specific goal, you can click on the appropriate link.</p>   

<h2>Theoretical goals</h2>

<p>We would very much like to have satisfactory answers to the following questions.</p>

<p><ol>
  <li><a href="/human_oriented_atp/motivated.html">What does it mean for a proof step to be fully motivated?</a></li>
</ol>
</p>

<h1>Contributing thoughts about theoretical questions</h1>

<p>One of the main strands of the project will be to attempt to answer various (mostly quite open-ended) theoretical questions connected with automatic theorem proving. Some preliminary discussion of these questions can be found in Section 8 of <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-FFa6nMVg18m1zPtoAQrFalwpx2YaGK4/view?usp=sharing">the long document that accompanied the first announcement of this project</a>. A high priority in the early stages of the project will be the first two questions listed there, which are really two aspects of the same question.</p>

<h2>1. Finding a formal notion of motivated proof.</h2>

<p>The first question is whether it is possible to formalize in a reasonable way the notion of a "fully motivated proof" -- that is, a proof for which the steps are not just correct, but are also explainable as the result of a natural search process. It is perhaps clearer to express the concept negatively: anyone with a mathematical background will have encountered "rabbits out of hats", that is, steps that appear to come out of nowhere but magically do the job required of them. But what exactly is it about such steps that causes us to view them this way? With a proper understanding of this, we could define a motivated proof to be one that contains no rabbits out of hats.</p>

<h2>2. Finding a small set of allowable move types.</h2>

<p>That is where the second question comes in. One potential approach to making precise the notion of what I shall call here a rabbit-free proof is to define a set of "move types" -- that is, methods of transforming a problem -- and defining a motivated proof to be one that can be generated using these move types. The idea is then to design the move types in such a way as to make it impossible to generate rabbits.</p>

<p>This idea does not make much sense without a fuller discussion, but to give an idea of what the distinction between a motivated proof and a regular proof might look like, consider a situation where one wishes to prove an existential statement -- that is, a statement of the form \(\exists x\in X\ P(x)\). A basic rule of logic is that if \(T\) is some term that defines an element of \(X\), then to prove the existential statement it is sufficient to prove the statement \(P(T)\). However, if \(T\) is a fairly complex term, and if the proof that \(P(T)\) holds is quite complicated, then this move can definitely fall into the rabbit-out-of-hat category. So in a <em>motivated</em> proof, we should not expect to allow arbitrary instantiation of an existentially quantified variable.</p>

<p>This might seem to be removing such a fundamental tool that it would make mathematics impossible. However, the word "arbitrary" was important. I do not propose disallowing <em>all</em> instantiation, but instantiation should use terms that are in some sense (to be made precise) <em>generated</em> out of the ingredients served up by the initial statement of the problem. To give a simple example, if we wish to solve the equation \(x^2-46x+525=0\) it is not enough (in a motivated proof) to say "Observe that 21 and 25 satisfy the equation." It is also not enough, though it is slightly better, to say, "Observe that \(x^2-46x+525=(x-23)^2-4\)." But it would be a lot better to say, "We know how to solve quadratic equations of the form $(x+a)^2=b$, so let's see whether we can put our equation into that form. Expanding and rearranging, we find that we would need to choose \(a\) and \(b\) in such a way that \(x^2+2ax+a^2-b=x^2-46x+525\), which tells us that \(a=-23\) and \(b=23^2-525=4\). Thus, our equation is equivalent to the equation \((x-23)^2=4\), which gives \(x=23\pm 2\)."</p>

<p>In the last case, we did not produce any numbers out of nowhere, and we did not produce an algebraic expression out of nowhere that magically happened to equal \((x-23)^2-4\). Even the idea of completing the square did not come out of nowhere, but rather from a natural thought process, that could be summarized as writing down the general form of an equation that we would feel comfortable solving, equating it with the equation we want to solve, obtaining easy equations for the unchosen parameters, and solving those.</p>

<p>That example is given mainly as a useful analogy. The idea is that moves such as instantiating a quantifier should be done only using elements that are generated from the problem itself using "standard moves", just as, for instance, the coefficients in the expression $(x-23)^2-4$ were obtained using some standard algebraic manipulations. But what are these standard moves? Does there even exist a finite set of moves that is sufficient? What should be allowed as a move and what should be forbidden?</p>

<p>Since these all seem to be hard questions and we are unlikely to be able just to write down a satisfactory set of moves without a great deal of thought, it is sensible to break down the question further.

<p>To be continued.</p>
