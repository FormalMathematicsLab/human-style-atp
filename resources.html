<h3 class="section-heading">Examples of the proof discovery process</h3>

<p> We are trying to formulate a notion of "motivated proof". Roughly speaking, this means a proof that does not involve rabbits being drawn out of hats. While we do not yet have a precise notion yet, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/motivatedproofexamples.html">we do have several examples</a>. </p>

<p> Two YouTube series of live problem-solving videos have been created by Tim Gowers. One focuses on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOft35kj95aajgXAFHKklygbpsESMQUid">problems that require the solver to find useful invariants</a>, while the other is for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOft35kj95aYGeaJQlD8NSroMlWfkiJ1F">problems that require clever colourings</a>. We would be delighted to link to similar videos made by others (of any kind of non-routine problem -- they don't have to be IMO-style problems): please let us know of any that you know of, or have made yourself.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">A list of challenge problems</h3>

<p> The problems that we are trying to solve is a little different in style from the benchmark problems one finds in typical databases, in that they are more like the easier problems that one might find in a mathematics undergraduate problem set. So we would like to create our own collection of problems and use it to measure our progress. We have made <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/problemlist.html">a start on this</a> and would welcome further suggestions. </p>

<h3 class ="section-heading">A large number of previously private blog posts</h3>

<p> For several years, Mohan Ganesalingam and Timothy Gowers collaborated using a private blog. <a href="https://robotmaths.wordpress.com/">The posts from that blog are now publicly accessible</a>. There are a lot of them, and many of the ideas they contain are fairly half baked, or superseded by later ideas that seem to work better. But a lot of them also represent trains of thought that were not fully explored and could be a useful starting point for further research.</p>
