<h2 class="section-heading">Project Overview</h2>

<p> <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2022/04/28/announcing-an-automatic-theorem-proving-project">An announcement of the project</a>.</p>

<p> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-FFa6nMVg18m1zPtoAQrFalwpx2YaGK4/view">A more detailed document about it</a>.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Minutes</h2>

<p> An <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/minutes.html">informal record</a> of meetings of participants based in Cambridge. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Examples of the proof discovery process</h2>

<p> We are trying to formulate a notion of "motivated proof". Roughly speaking, this means a proof that does not involve rabbits being drawn out of hats. While we do not yet have a precise notion yet, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/motivatedproofexamples.html">we do have several examples</a>. </p>

<p> Two YouTube series of live problem-solving videos have been created by Tim Gowers. One focuses on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOft35kj95aajgXAFHKklygbpsESMQUid">problems that require the solver to find useful invariants</a>, while the other is for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOft35kj95aYGeaJQlD8NSroMlWfkiJ1F">problems that require clever colourings</a>. We would be delighted to link to similar videos made by others (of any kind of non-routine problem -- they don't have to be IMO-style problems): please let us know of any that you know of, or have made yourself.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">A list of challenge problems</h2>

<p> The problems that we are trying to solve is a little different in style from the benchmark problems one finds in typical databases, in that they are more like the easier problems that one might find in a mathematics undergraduate problem set. So we would like to create our own collection of problems and use it to measure our progress. We have made <href="{{site.baseurl}}/problemlist.html">a start on this</a> and would welcome further suggestions. </p>
