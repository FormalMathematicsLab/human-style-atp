<strong>Topological spaces.</strong>

A union of two compact sets is compact.

A compact subset of a Hausdorff topological space is closed.

A continuous image of a compact set is compact.

A closed subset of a compact set is compact.

A composition of continuous functions is continuous.

$\overline{\overline{A}}=\overline{A}$ for every set $A$.

If \(f(\overline{A})\subset\overline{f(A)}\) for every \(A\) then \(f\) is continuous.

If \(f\) is continuous then \(f(\overline{A})\subset\overline{f(A)}\) for every \(A\).

If \(f\) is continuous then for every neighbourhood \(N\) of \(f(x)\) there is a neighbourhood \(M\) of \(x\) such that \(f(M)\subset N\).

If for every \(x\) and for every neighbourhood \(N\) of \(f(x)\) there is a neighbourhood \(M\) of \(x\) such that \(f(M)\subset N\), then \(f\) is continuous.

<strong>Metric spaces.</strong>

A metric space is Hausdorff.

The intersection of two open sets is open.

A union of open sets is open.

If f is continuous and $latex a_n\to a$ then $latex f(a_n)\to f(a)$ (where f is a function between metric spaces).

If $latex f(a_n)\to f(a)$ whenever $latex a_n\to a$ then f is continuous.

If f is continuous and $latex U$ is open then $latex f^{-1}(U)$ is open.

If $latex f^{-1}(U)$ is open whenever U is open then f is continuous.

A uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous.

A sequence (in a metric space) has at most one limit.

A continuous function on a sequentially compact metric space is bounded.

Every sequentially compact metric space is complete.

A composition of continuous functions is continuous.

Every closed set contains its limit points.

Every set that contains all its limit points is closed.

If X is compact and $latex f:X\to X$ is a map such that $latex d(f(x),f(y))<d(x,y)$ whenever $latex x\ne y,$ then $latex f$ has a fixed point.

Open balls are open.

<strong>Sets.</strong>

$f^{-1}(A\cup B)\subset f^{-1}(A)\cup f^{-1}(B).$

$f(f^{-1}(B))\subset B.$

$A\subset f^{-1}(f(A)).$
