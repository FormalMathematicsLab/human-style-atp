## What is the problem?

Expanding a definition is a move that we make all the time when solving problems. However, we also prefer high-level arguments when we can find them. So it makes sense to prefer reasoning moves to expansions, which can be done by simply giving them higher priority. But should we always expand when there is nothing else to do? Might that sometimes lead to situations where we keep on and on expanding when there is obviously nothing to be gained from doing so? (An example of this would be if the program is asked to prove something but not given enough hypotheses to work with: do we want it desperately to expand under such circumstances, or should it have ways of recognising that there is nothing to be gained?)
