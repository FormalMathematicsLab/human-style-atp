Turán's theorem for triangles, otherwise known as Mantel's theorem, is the statement that the largest number of edges that a triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices can have is $\lfloor n/2\rfloor\lceil n/2\rceil$, with equality attained if and only if the graph is a complete bipartite graph /and the two vertex sets are as close in size as possible.

Here is a sketch of a proof of the result. We shall prove it by induction on $n$. Write $t_3(n)$ for the quantity $\lfloor n/2\rfloor\lceil n/2\rceil$. The theorem is trivial for $n=1$, since a 1-vertex graph has $t_3(1)=0$ edges. In general, if $G$ is an $(n+1)$-vertex graph with $m$ edges and no triangles, then the average degree is $2m/(n+1)$, so one can find a vertex of degree at most $2m/(n+1)$. Removing that vertex gives a graph with at least $m(1-2/(n+1))$ edges and at most $t_3(n)$ edges, by the inductive hypothesis, so we obtain an upper bound for $m$. Some slightly tedious calculation shows that we can obtain an upper bound of $t_3(n+1)$. Furthermore, if we have equality, then the graph we obtain after removing a minimal-degree vertex must have exactly $t_3(n)$ edges (again by a small calculation) so it is a complete bipartite graph with vertex sets of almost equal size or equal size, and then it is easy to see that the best we can do to extend it is to connect the new vertex to all the vertices in one of the vertex classes -- and if they are not of exactly equal size to connect it to the larger one. 

However, this post is not about finding that proof, but about a slightly different question. Suppose that instead of being asked to prove the result as just stated, one is simply asked how many edges a triangle-free graph with $n$ vertices can have, and which graphs maximize the number of edges. First of all, it is not altogether clear how to ask this question formally, since it is not enough to prove that there *exists* a maximal number of edges and a class of graphs that achieves the maximum: we are required to *identify* the maximal number and the class. In practice that means giving a formula for the maximal number, and a description of all graphs that achieve the maximum. But what constitutes a formula, and what constitutes a description. 

As an example of an unsatisfactory answer to the second question, suppose we have written a formula for $t_3(n)$. It would not be all right to say that the class of graphs that achieves the maximum is precisely the class of all triangle-free graphs with $n$ vertices and $t_3(n)$ edges. Somehow we want a description that doesn't trivially imply the property we want it to imply. 

Using the analogy of solving equations, which I find repeatedly helpful, it is as though one were asked to find a real number $x$ such that $x^3+8x=51$. If one argued first that $x\mapsto x^3+8x$ is a strictly increasing function that takes both positive and negative values, so there is a unique $x$ such that it equals 51, then that would be correctly showing that such an $x$ *existed* but it would not be *finding* one. If on the other hand one points out that $3^3+8\cdot 3=51$, then that certainly would count as a solution. 

Typically, to solve equations we simplify them until they reach a particularly basic form and only *then* allow ourselves a trivial solution. For instance, we might complete the square to turn a quadratic equation into $(x-1)^2=2$, at which point we would allow the trivial solution $x-1=\pm\sqrt 2$, which we would then put into the form $x-1=1\pm\sqrt 2$. 

So for us, even if "find" isn't a formally defined mathematical word, and there is no single universally accepted notion of "explicit solution", what we can aspire for the program to do is create a metavariable and then simplify the problem state until it can use a very easy problem, the solution to which was in the library.
