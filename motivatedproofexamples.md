This page will mostly consist of links to files that contain examples that people have come up with of proofs (or more precisely proof write-ups) that we would like to count as "motivated". Informally, this means that it is clear where every proof step has come from. In particular, if an existential statement is to be proved, or a universally quantified statement is to be instantiated, it is not enough simply to substitute in an expression that works: the expression has to emerge as a "solution", often as a result of the problem being "reduced" to something significantly simpler.
